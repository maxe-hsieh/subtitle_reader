2. Focus must be on the video player to hear the subtitles, and usually the current time, volume, and controls for setting the video playback are all part of the video player's range.
3. Please confirm that the video has CC subtitles available, if it does, you can use the browsing mode to find the dynamic subtitle text.
4. If the website updates its playback interface, the subtitle reader will become invalid, please wait for the subtitle reader to be updated, or contact me using the contact information below.
